# Biography

Hi, I'm a research assistant at Penn State University researching plant-associated microbes, carbohydrate-active enzyme evolution, and plant growth. For the last six years I've worked in Daniel Cosgrove's lab where my research focuses on a class of proteins called expansins. Expansins are proteins that allow plants to grow, and are also found in a diverse set of microbes where they serve various purposes. Currently, I study expansin structure, function, and evolution using experimental and computational techniques. I also study plant cell wall structure using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). 

I love the R programming language and (semi) regularly share my triumphs and failures here on my blog. I'm also interested in the diverse microbes that blanket our planet and how they built the world in which we live. Some big questions I think about: What allows certain microbes to thrive in an environment? How do those microbes influence the environments they inhabit? And what can this tell us about the history of our planet and life as we know it today? 

As scientists, it is our responsibility to share and represent our work in the best light possible. I hope to use this platform (and others) as a place to share my work, share my thoughts on academia, and trumpet the amazing virtues of science to whomever is listening.
