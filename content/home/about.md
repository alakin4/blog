# Biography

Hi, I'm Will, a data scientist at Upenn. I love the R programming language and share my triumphs and failures here on my blog. My day job focuses on data visualization, bioinformatics, and biostatistics, while my nights and weekends are spent making generative and algorithmic art. In a former life I was a microbiologist and plant biologist, and while I gave up the pipets, I kept my love of wonderfully weird biology, which inspires much of my current work. If you like R, dataviz, generative art, and fresh gifs, follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/W_R_Chase" target="_blank">@W_R_Chase</a>.
