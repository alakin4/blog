# Biography

Hi, I'm a research assistant at Penn State University researching plant-associated microbes, carbohydrate-active enzyme evolution, and plant growth. I love the R programming language and (semi) regularly share my triumphs and failures here on my blog. I'm also interested in the diverse microbes that blanket our planet and how they built the world in which we live. Some big questions I think about: What allows certain microbes to thrive in an environment? How do those microbes influence the environments they inhabit? And what can this tell us about the history of our planet and life as we know it today? I hope to use this platform as a place to share my work, share my thoughts on academia, and trumpet the amazing virtues of science to whomever is listening.
