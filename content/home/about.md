# Biography

Hi, I'm a research assistant at Penn State University researching plant growth. For the last six years I've worked in Daniel Cosgrove's lab where my research focuses on a class of proteins called expansins. Expansins are proteins that allow plants to grow, and are also found in a diverse set of microbes where they serve various purposes. I study expansin structure, function, and evolution using experimental and computational techniques. I also study plant cell wall structure using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). I love the R programming language and frequently share my triumphs and failures here on my blog.
