*Disclamer: I'm a trained microbiologist/biochemist, which means most of my bioinformatics knowledge was self-taught. What you're about to see may not be pretty; the code might be janky or the workflow inefficient. But I have gone through countless hours of googleing, reading, and trial/error to learn this, and it works pretty well for me, so it might for you too. Let me know if you spot errors or have suggestions for improvement!*
